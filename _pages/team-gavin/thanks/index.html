<h3>Got it! Thanks for submitting.</h3>

<hr>

<p>In order for your picks to count for the week - your payment must be received no later than Sunday night of the current week. If you'd like to prepay for the season (at any time) instead of paying each week - <a href="mailto:{{ site.email }}?Subject=Football" target="_top">send me a note</a> and we can take care of that.</p>

<p>Payments are made through PayPal. Winners will be paid out from PayPal. Thanks to our sponsor - <a href="https://qoppa.co" style="color: #ef272d;">Qoppa Web Design and Development</a> - for sponsoring this site and covering all transaction fees for payments.</p>

<hr>

<p>If you have any feedback, suggestions, or improvement requests for <a href="/">officefootball.club</a>, please let me know and I will do my very best to keep making it better throughout the season!</p>

<p>Thanks,<br><img src="/images/signature2.png" alt="Max Quattromani"></p>
